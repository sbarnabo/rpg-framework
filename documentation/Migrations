To automate SQL table creation in your project, you can leverage **database migrations**. Migrations allow you to version control your database schema changes and apply those changes automatically as part of your project's build or runtime process.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can integrate migrations into your project, specifically using **SQLx** with Rust.

### 1. **Set Up Diesel or SQLx for Migrations**

In Rust, there are a couple of popular libraries to handle migrations: **Diesel** and **SQLx**. Since you're using `SQLx` already in your project, we’ll focus on using SQLx for migrations.

**SQLx** offers an easy way to write migrations manually, store them in versioned files, and apply them to the database.

### 2. **Install SQLx Migration CLI**

First, you’ll need the `sqlx-cli` to manage the migrations. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

This will install the SQLx command-line tool that can help with database migrations.

### 3. **Create Migration Files**

SQLx migrations are simply SQL files that describe changes to the database schema. To generate a new migration file, use the following command:

```bash
sqlx migrate add create_skills_table
```

This will generate a new migration file inside the `migrations` folder, typically located at the root of your project. The migration file will be named something like:

```
migrations/
  └── 20230415085325_create_skills_table.sql
```

### 4. **Edit the Migration File**

You will now add the SQL schema for your tables inside this generated migration file. For example:

```sql
-- 20230415085325_create_skills_table.sql

-- Skills Table
CREATE TABLE skills (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    skill_type VARCHAR(50),
    power INT,
    cooldown INT,
    mana_cost INT,
    target_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add other tables like player_skills, pet_skills, etc., if necessary
```

Make sure you include all necessary schema changes in this migration file.

### 5. **Run Migrations**

Now that your migration file is created and edited, you can apply the migrations to your database. Run the following command:

```bash
sqlx migrate run
```

This will apply all pending migrations to your database. It will automatically track which migrations have been applied and apply any new migrations you add.

### 6. **Integrate Migrations into Your Application**

You can automate migrations when your application starts up by adding a call to apply migrations in your `main.rs` (or wherever your database connection is initialized). This way, whenever the backend service is started, SQLx will automatically apply any new migrations.

For example, in your `main.rs`:

```rust
use sqlx::PgPool;
use sqlx::migrate::Migrator;
use std::env;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    dotenv().ok();

    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    let pool = PgPool::connect(&database_url)
        .await
        .expect("Failed to connect to the database");

    // Apply migrations automatically on startup
    let migrator = Migrator::new(std::path::Path::new("migrations")).await.unwrap();
    migrator.run(&pool).await.unwrap();

    println!("Migrations applied successfully");

    // Continue with the rest of your app initialization
}
```

In the example above:
- `Migrator::new("migrations")` will look for your migration files in the `migrations` folder.
- `migrator.run(&pool).await.unwrap();` will apply any new migrations to the database.

### 7. **Testing Migrations**

Once you've set this up, you can test it by:
1. Starting your backend service with `cargo run`.
2. Checking if the tables have been created in the database.

You can also manually inspect the database with a PostgreSQL client (e.g., `psql`, `pgAdmin`, or DBeaver) to verify that the `skills` and related tables exist.

### 8. **Adding Future Migrations**

Whenever you need to update the schema (e.g., add new tables or columns), you’ll repeat the process:
1. Create a new migration with `sqlx migrate add <migration_name>`.
2. Add your SQL schema changes in the migration file.
3. Run `sqlx migrate run` to apply the migrations.

### 9. **Handling Errors**

If you encounter errors during migration (e.g., schema mismatches or unexpected changes), SQLx will prevent the migration from running and provide an error message. You can adjust your migrations and re-run them until they work.

### Example of Full Database Migration Setup:

Here’s a quick overview of the process:

1. **Create migration files**:
   - `sqlx migrate add create_skills_table`
   - `sqlx migrate add create_player_skills_table`

2. **Edit the migration files**:
   - Define `skills`, `player_skills`, and other related tables in SQL.

3. **Run migrations**:
   - `sqlx migrate run` to apply migrations to the database.

4. **Automate migrations on startup**:
   - Call `migrator.run(&pool).await.unwrap();` in your app’s `main` function.

### Final Thoughts

By automating migrations with SQLx, you ensure that your database schema is always up to date with your codebase, and that you can easily track and revert changes over time.
