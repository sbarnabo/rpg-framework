Perfect — let’s get **Buildx** set up on your Raspberry Pi so you can build **multi-architecture Docker images**, use advanced caching, and prepare for future scalability (like CI builds for ARM and x86).

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Install and Enable Docker Buildx on Raspberry Pi

### 🧱 1. **Verify Docker Version**
You need Docker 19.03+ (Buildx is included but may need enabling).

Run:
```bash
docker version
```

Look for something like:
```
Version: 20.10.x
```

If you're below `19.03`, upgrade Docker first.

---

### 🧰 2. **Enable the Experimental CLI Features**
Run:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker
```

Edit or create `~/.docker/config.json`:
```json
{
  "experimental": "enabled"
}
```

---

### 🧪 3. **Check if Buildx is Available**
Run:
```bash
docker buildx version
```

If successful, you’ll see something like:
```
github.com/docker/buildx v0.10.0 ...
```

---

### 🔧 4. **Create a Buildx Builder**
```bash
docker buildx create --name rpg-builder --use
```

Verify:
```bash
docker buildx ls
```

Output:
```
NAME/NODE       DRIVER/ENDPOINT             STATUS   PLATFORMS
rpg-builder*    docker-container            running  linux/arm64
```

> If you see `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/amd64`, or `linux/arm64`, you’re golden.

---

### 🌍 5. (Optional) **Enable Cross-Platform Builds with QEMU**
Install emulation support so you can build images for **x86_64** and others from your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```

Confirm:
```bash
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

You should see multiple platforms like:
```
Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7
```

---

### 🧪 6. **Test a Multi-Arch Build**
Here’s a quick build to test:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -t yourname/rpg-backend:multiarch --push .
```

> Add `--load` instead of `--push` if you don’t want to upload to Docker Hub yet.

---

### 🔁 7. **Persist Builder Across Reboots (Optional)**
Docker Desktop does this automatically, but on Raspberry Pi you may want to ensure your builder is recreated on boot using a script or Docker Compose init container.

Would you like help:
- Integrating Buildx into Jenkins pipelines?
- Adding `frontend` support for multi-arch builds?
- Creating `Makefile` or `justfile` to automate builds?
