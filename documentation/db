Perfect! Letâ€™s walk through this together and make it clear and actionable.

Since you're building a backend in Rust and using PostgreSQL, and your models are defined in Rust, the goal is to **translate these Rust data structures into corresponding SQL table schemas.**

Weâ€™ll break this process into simple steps:

---

### âœ… Step 1: Understand the Data Model Structure

Letâ€™s say you have a basic character model in Rust like this (likely found in `models/character.rs`):

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Character {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub class: String,
    pub level: i32,
    pub experience: i32,
}
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Translate to SQL Table Schema

You would create a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE characters (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    class TEXT NOT NULL,
    level INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    experience INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

### âœ… Step 3: Choose a Migration Tool

To manage your schema over time, use a migration tool compatible with Rust + PostgreSQL:

**Recommended tool:** [`sqlx-cli`](https://docs.rs/sqlx/latest/sqlx/macro.query.html#compile-time-checked-queries-sqlxmacros)

1. Add `sqlx` to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["postgres", "runtime-tokio-native-tls"] }
   ```

2. Install the CLI:
   ```bash
   cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres
   ```

3. Set up `.env` for sqlx:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://rpg_user:rpg_pass@localhost:5432/rpg
   ```

4. Create your first migration:
   ```bash
   sqlx migrate add create_characters
   ```

   It creates a file in `migrations/` like:
   ```
   20250409120000_create_characters.sql
   ```

5. Paste your SQL schema into that file.

6. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

### âœ… Step 4: Sync Rust Structs With Schema

Optionally, if you want Rust to "talk" to the DB with less manual SQL:

```rust
use sqlx::FromRow;

#[derive(Debug, FromRow)]
pub struct Character {
    pub id: i32,
    pub name: String,
    pub class: String,
    pub level: i32,
    pub experience: i32,
}
```

And query like this:

```rust
let characters = sqlx::query_as::<_, Character>("SELECT * FROM characters")
    .fetch_all(&pool)
    .await?;
```

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

If youâ€™d like, I can help you:
- Scaffold the full `models` module.
- Generate SQL for each model.
- Set up the migrations in your current backend directory.
