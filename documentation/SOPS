Great choice! SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) is an excellent tool for managing secrets in a way that is both secure and integrates easily with version control. It encrypts your secrets and can decrypt them when needed, making it perfect for use in a project with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and other environments where you need to store sensitive data.

Here’s how you can integrate **SOPS** into your project:

### 1. **Install SOPS**
First, you need to install SOPS on your local machine and your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins). You can install it via the following methods:

#### For macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install sops
```

#### For Linux:
Download the latest release from the GitHub [SOPS Releases page](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases) or use a package manager.

#### For Windows:
Download the executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases).

### 2. **Generate Your Encryption Keys**
SOPS supports encrypting secrets using various key management systems like AWS KMS, GCP KMS, PGP, and more. Here’s how you can use **PGP** to encrypt and decrypt secrets:

- **Generate a PGP Key** (if you don't have one):
  ```bash
  gpg --full-generate-key
  ```

- Once your key is generated, list the key IDs:
  ```bash
  gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
  ```

- Copy the `sec` key ID from the output. This will be used to encrypt and decrypt files.

### 3. **Encrypt Secrets Using SOPS**

#### Create a `secrets.env` file:
You can create a `.env` file or any other file that will hold your sensitive information.

Example `secrets.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://rpg_user:rpg_pass@db:5432/rpg
SECRET_KEY=supersecretkey
API_KEY=some-api-key
```

#### Encrypt the File:
Now, use SOPS to encrypt the file:
```bash
sops -e secrets.env > secrets.env.enc
```
This will create an encrypted version of the `secrets.env` file named `secrets.env.enc`.

SOPS will automatically use your PGP key to encrypt the file. The encrypted file can be safely committed to your version control system (Git), as it is not in plaintext.

### 4. **Decrypt Secrets When Needed**

To decrypt the secrets in a running environment, you can use SOPS like so:

```bash
sops -d secrets.env.enc > secrets.env
```

This will decrypt the contents and output the decrypted `secrets.env` file that can be loaded into your Docker containers or used in CI/CD pipelines.

### 5. **Integrate SOPS with Docker**

You can use a script to decrypt the secrets before starting your containers. Here’s how you might set it up in a `docker-compose.override.yml` or in your entrypoint script:

#### Example Entry Point Script (`entrypoint.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Decrypt secrets using SOPS
sops -d /secrets/secrets.env.enc > /secrets/secrets.env

# Run the application (e.g., backend)
exec "$@"
```

Make sure that the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

Now, in your `docker-compose.yml`, you can add the entry point to use this script.

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    container_name: rpg-backend
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL
      - SECRET_KEY
      - API_KEY
    volumes:
      - ./secrets:/secrets  # Mount the decrypted secrets
    entrypoint: /secrets/entrypoint.sh  # Run the entrypoint script
    depends_on:
      - db
```

This ensures that when the container starts, it decrypts the secrets into environment variables that the application can use.

### 6. **Integrating with Jenkins**

In your Jenkins pipeline, you can integrate SOPS to decrypt secrets as part of the build process. Here's how you could decrypt secrets during a Jenkins build:

- **Install SOPS on the Jenkins Agent**:
  - You can install SOPS in your Jenkins agent container or as part of the agent setup.
  - You can use a Docker image that has SOPS pre-installed or install it as part of the `Jenkinsfile` pipeline.

- **Jenkinsfile Example for Decrypting Secrets**:
  In your Jenkinsfile, you can add steps to decrypt the secrets before running the build.

  ```groovy
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Setup') {
        steps {
          script {
            // Decrypt the secrets using SOPS
            sh 'sops -d secrets/secrets.env.enc > secrets/secrets.env'
          }
        }
      }
      stage('Build') {
        steps {
          // Run the build or tests
          sh './gradlew build'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 7. **Commit the Encrypted Secrets to Git**

Once your secrets are encrypted, you can commit the encrypted secrets file (`secrets.env.enc`) to your Git repository:

```bash
git add secrets.env.enc
git commit -m "Add encrypted secrets"
git push
```

This keeps your sensitive data safe, as it is encrypted and only accessible to those with the right decryption keys.

### 8. **Automate Decryption in CI/CD**

You can automate the decryption of secrets in your Jenkins pipeline or Docker environment by using environment variables for the decryption key or relying on a key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for encryption/decryption.

---

### **Security Considerations**:
- **Protect Your Keys**: Make sure your PGP keys are kept secure, and use environment variables or a key management service to store them safely.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users or services have access to the keys used for encryption and decryption.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Avoid storing plaintext secrets in Jenkins or other build systems. Use encrypted secrets and decrypt them during the build process.

By using **SOPS**, you can securely manage secrets and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline with Docker and Jenkins while ensuring that secrets remain encrypted at rest.
