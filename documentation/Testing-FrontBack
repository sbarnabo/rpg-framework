Perfect! Here's how you can **test the `/api/health` endpoint integration** between your frontend and backend.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

### 🧪 1. Confirm Your Backend Route

Make sure your backend is exposing the health route at `/api/health`.

Your `main.rs` should have something like:

```rust
let app = Router::new()
    .route("/api/health", get(health_check))
    .layer(Extension(pool));
```

This is already in place if you followed the previous backend setup.

---

### 🔁 2. Ensure Docker Networking via Traefik

In your `docker-compose.yml`, you should have both `frontend` and `backend` connected to the same Traefik network. Example:

```yaml
networks:
  traefik:
    external: true
  frontend:
```

Both containers must use `networks: [ traefik, frontend ]`.

Also make sure the `backend` is accessible under a Traefik host like:

```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.backend.rule=Host(`api.barnabo-connect.com`)"
```

---

### 🌐 3. Tell the Frontend Where to Find the Backend

If you’re testing **in production with Docker and Traefik**, the frontend will make calls to `https://api.barnabo-connect.com/api/health`.

In `Terminal.tsx`, update your Axios call:

```tsx
axios.get("https://api.barnabo-connect.com/api/health")
```

If you're testing **locally during development**, you can use a proxy. Add this to the **root of your frontend project**:

### `vite.config.ts`

```ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false
    }
  }
}
```

Now your frontend can use `axios.get("/api/health")` in development and it will automatically forward to your local backend.

---

### 🚀 4. Run the Frontend + Backend

Make sure both services are running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Then visit:

```
https://game.barnabo-connect.com
```

You should see:

```
✅ Backend is online.
```

---

### 🐞 If Something Doesn’t Work

Check these things:
- Logs: `docker logs rpg-frontend` and `docker logs rpg-backend`
- Is Traefik resolving your subdomains?
- Does the backend route really start with `/api/`?

---

Would you like help validating the DNS/Traefik config or want a testing script to confirm the endpoint externally?
